# ZeroMedium
Medium for ZeroNet

*Current Stable Version*: 17-11b

* run `gulp` to combine and move over javascript files to `js` folder, to copy over html files to root, and to compile sass into css and put into `css` folder.
* The `src` folder should be ignored by ZeroNet.

Update: ZeroMedium no longer uses Typescript (there were problems with it and vue and I didn't want to spend forever trying to figure them out).

**NOTE:** This repo uses the GitFlow development model, which you can read about [here](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) and [here](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html).

TODO:
