# ZeroMedium
Medium for ZeroNet

*Current Stable Version*: 17-11b

* run `gulp` to combine and move over javascript files to `js` folder, to copy over html files to root, and to compile sass into css and put into `css` folder.
* The `src` folder should be ignored by ZeroNet.

Update: ZeroMedium no longer uses Typescript (there were problems with it and vue and I didn't want to spend forever trying to figure them out).

TODO: 
* Change gulp-minify-css to gulp-clean-css
